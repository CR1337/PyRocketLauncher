# PyRocketLauncher

## Description
This software was designed for a custom built fireworks ignition system. The corresponding hardware is based on a Raspberry Pi together with one or more [TLC59116](https://github.com/CR1337/PyRocketLauncher/blob/dev/doc/tlc59116.pdf) to control a driver stage that drives eletric igniters. The Raspberry Pi communicates with the TLC59116 via an IÂ²C interface. This communication is controlled by this software. In addition this software provides a browser based frontend for easy user intercation with the system.
